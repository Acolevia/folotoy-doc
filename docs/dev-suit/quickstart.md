## Quick Start
**Hardware connection**: Connect the button/speaker/microphone and other components to the extension baseboard. Use a USB cable or battery (can be connected at the same time) to power the development board. Rotate the knob switch clockwise to the limit position, and the LED indicator on the Folotoy Core mainboard will light up.

**Network configuration**: Press and hold ButtonB and ButtonC for more than 3 seconds. The RGB light will flash blue, indicating that you can connect to the Folotoy-XXXX Wi-Fi hotspot with your phone. Your phone should automatically open the network configuration page, where you can configure the Wi-Fi name/Wi-Fi password/server IP/server port. See here for how to configure the server.

**Start using**: Press and hold ButtonA, and the RGB light strip will turn green. At this point, you can talk to the microphone. After ending the conversation, you can release ButtonA. The RGB light strip will then display a rainbow gradation flash, and after about 2~5 seconds (this time is usually affected by network latency, if the network conditions are poor, it may be longer or timing out), you will hear a response.
