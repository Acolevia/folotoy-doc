According to the English labels on the board, connect the components as follows:

| Interface Label | Component |
|  ----  | ----  |
| Volume, Power switch | Volume Control and Switch Knob Module |
| Speaker | Speaker |
| Battery | Battery |
| W52812 | RGB Light Module (Connect from the board's RGB interface to the module's IN port, then from the module's OUT port to the IN port of another module) |

### Powering On

Once all components are connected, rotating the switch will power on the development board and enter configuration mode, with the LED light displaying a "üîµ blue breathing effect." If the switch does not work and the board powers on automatically, you can adjust the small switch on the core board to change the configuration.

## Wi-Fi Configuration

[Device Configuration and Server Setup](../manual/wifi-connect.md)

### How to Enter Configuration Mode
* Press and hold Button B for more than 3 seconds; the LED light will turn to a blue breathing flashing state.
* Open your phone and connect to the Folotoy-xxxx Wi-Fi hotspot; your phone will automatically open the network configuration page where you can configure the Wi-Fi name/Wi-Fi password/server IP/server port.
* Once the LED is in the blue breathing flashing state, the configuration process is the same as the initial setup.

<!-- ## Configuring the Development Kit and Connecting to the Test Server

### Initial Configuration

After powering on for the first time, the development kit will automatically enter configuration mode. Use your phone or computer to search for Wi-Fi networks, and you will see a wireless network starting with `FoloToy-`. Select `FoloToy-`, and after a short wait, your phone or computer will automatically display the configuration page. If you connect to `FoloToy-` but the configuration page does not appear, you can open a browser on your phone or computer and directly enter http://192.168.4.1 for configuration.

FoloToy provides a test MQTT server:

* Address: 47.116.13.134
* Port: 1883

If you wish to set up your own server, please [refer to the server deployment instructions here](../installation/1panel.md) and choose a suitable solution.

### Reconfiguration

If you have already configured the device and want to reconfigure it, follow these steps:

* Press and hold both Button B and Button C for more than 3 seconds; the LED light will turn to a blue breathing flashing state.
* Open your phone and connect to the Folotoy- Wi-Fi hotspot; your phone will automatically open the network configuration page where you can configure the Wi-Fi name/Wi-Fi password/server IP/server port.
* Once the LED is in the blue breathing flashing state, the configuration process is the same as the initial setup.

The expansion board has 3 buttons, and there are markings on the board as shown in the image.

### Starting a Dialogue

Follow these steps to start a dialogue:

* Long press Button A; the LED light will turn green and stay on, indicating that recording is in progress. You can then speak into the microphone.
* Release Button A when you finish speaking; the LED light will turn to a green breathing flashing state, indicating that the AI is processing.
* After about 2-5 seconds (the time may vary depending on network delays; it may be longer or result in a timeout under poor network conditions), you will hear the speaker providing a response.
* Short press Button B to cycle through roles; the server can be configured to support 7 different roles.
* If the voice wakeup module is included, the default wakeup word is "hi folo" (sounds like "follow"). When the device detects the wakeup word, it will play a ‚Äúreceived‚Äù sound prompt, and you can then speak directly to the device. The device will automatically stop recording after you stop speaking (if it fails to recognize the end of speech, use AT commands to adjust the voice threshold. For AT command usage: [AT Commands](../at-command.mdx))
