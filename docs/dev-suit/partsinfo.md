### Core Board
The Core board (Folotoy Core) connects to the interface expansion board via two 20Pin 2.0mm pitch headers. Enthusiasts can design their own expansion boards.

### Interface Expansion Board
The interface expansion board mainly extends various peripheral interfaces for the core board, with the following expansion interfaces:
- Core Board Interface: 1 x 2.0 female header - 20Pin*2
- Button Interface: 3 x PH2.0-2Pin, the LED next to the button expansion interface will light up when the button is pressed
- Microphone Interface: 1 x PH2.0-2Pin
- Speaker Interface: 1 x PH2.0-2Pin
- RGB Light Strip Interface: 1 x PH2.0-3Pin
- Battery Interface: 1 x PH2.0-2Pin
- USB Interface: 1 x TypeC
- Charging Indicator Light: To indicate charging status
- Volume Adjustment Interface: 1 x XH2.54-3Pin
- Switch Interface: 1 x XH2.54-2Pin

### Buttons
Three buttons, when the button is pressed, the signal is connected.

### Microphone
The microphone uses an electret microphone.

### Speaker
The speaker uses a 3W 4Î© speaker.

### RGB Light Strip
The WS2812B programmable light strip is used.

### Volume Adjustment and Switch Knob
